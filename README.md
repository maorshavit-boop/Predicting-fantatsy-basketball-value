# Overview
I'm a junior data science student at Tel Aviv University, and I've decided to take on some machine learning projects this summer. For the second project, I'm building a model to predict NBA players fantasy value based on 9cat-H2H format —an idea inspired by my friend and I 'addiction' to NBA fantasy.
