    "#### 1. Problem Statement -\n",
    " - <u>Objective:</u> Objective: Predict individual NBA player statistics (PTS, REB, AST, STL, BLK, 3PM, FG%, FT%, TO) for the upcoming season to support fantasy basketball decisions in a 9-category Head-to-Head (H2H) league format.\n",
    " - <u>Why it matters:</u> In fantasy basketball, especially in the 9-cat H2H format, success depends on forecasting player performance across multiple statistical categories, not just points.\n",
    " - <u>Practical Outcome:</u> A system that predicts performance in each category per player and his total outcome, enabling data-driven team-building recommendations.\n",
    "#### 2. Data Collection - \n",
    " - NBA API - Used to get updated data (e.g., average stats).\n",
    " - Kaggle - \"NBA - Player stats - Season 24/25\" (per game stats until all-star break), \"NBA Players Stats 23/24\", \"2022-2023 NBA Player Stats\"\n",
    " - Basketball Reference - Manually downloaded per-game and total stats for seasons 2020-2021 ,2021-2022 ,2022-2023, 2023-2024, and 2024-2025. (Consistency in date formatting.)\n",
    "#### 3. Method - \n",
    " - Measuring player performance based on the Z-score (a common ranking system in the 9-cat H2H format).\n",
    " - **Formula** - per-category Z-score is calculated as $Z = (\\text{value} - \\text{mean}) / \\text{std}$. For Turnovers (TOV), the sign is flipped: $Z = (\\text{mean} - \\text{TOV}) / \\text{std}$ (as higher TOV is detrimental).\n",
    " - For the first task, I will predict the total Z-score across a season for fantasy players. The model will be trained on data from the 2021-2024 seasons, tested on the 2024-2025 season, and used to provide predictions for the upcoming 2025-2026 season.\n",
    " - **Regression models** -  \n",
    "     - OLS (ordinary least squares) by statmodels - the foundational technique of linear regression. It works by finding the line (or hyperplane) that minimizes the sum of the squared vertical distances (residuals) between the data points and the line.\n",
    "     - Linear Regression - the general model that assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable, most often using the OLS method to find the best-fitting coefficients.\n",
    "     - Ridge Regression - a variation of linear regression that introduces L2 regularization. This technique adds a penalty to the OLS loss function based on the square of the coefficient magnitudes. Its primary purpose is to shrink the coefficients towards zero, which helps prevent overfitting and improves stability in cases where features are highly correlated (multicollinearity).\n",
    "     - Linear Regression + PCA - a two-stage modeling approach. PCA is first applied to the data to reduce its dimensionality by transforming the original features into a smaller, uncorrelated set of components. Linear Regression is then performed on these new components.\n",
    "     - Random Forest Regressor - a powerful ensemble method. It constructs multiple independent Decision Trees during training and computes the final prediction by taking the average of the individual tree predictions. This averaging process makes the model robust to outliers and generally highly accurate.\n",
    "     - XGBoost Regressor (Extreme Gradient Boosting) - a state-of-the-art Gradient Boosting ensemble technique. It builds trees sequentially, where each new tree is designed to correct the errors left by the previous ensemble of trees. It is well-regarded for its high efficiency and top-tier predictive performance across many datasets.\n",
    " - **Evaluation metrics** -\n",
    "   * R-squared - a fundamental metric that represents the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is explained by the features in the model. A score of 1.0 indicates a perfect fit, while 0.0 means the model performs no better than simply predicting the mean of the target variable.\n",
    "   * RMSE (root mean squared error) - measures the square root of the average of the squared errors. Because errors are squared before being averaged, this metric is highly sensitive to large errors (outliers), making it the preferred choice when you need to severely penalize poor predictions. \n",
    "   * MAE (mean absoulte error) - measures the average of the absolute differences between the model's predictions and the actual values. It is less sensitive to outliers than RMSE and provides an error value that is in the same units as the target variable, making it very interpretable.\n",
    "   * Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) - calculates the average of the absolute percentage errors. This is a scale-independent metric that expresses the model's accuracy as a percentage of the actual value, providing a highly intuitive measure for business interpretation.\n",
    "   * Adjusted R-squared - improves upon $R^2$ by penalizing the metric when new features are added that do not significantly contribute to the model's predictive power. This makes it a more reliable metric for comparing models that contain different numbers of features."

    "### Initial EDA conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "**The analysis of the data reveals several key correlations and distribution patterns among the features.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "* A **strong positive correlation** is observed among points, assists, and turnovers. This suggests that players who are primary scorers and ball-handlers tend to have more opportunities for assists but also assume greater risk, which can lead to a higher frequency of turnovers.\n",
    "* Rebounds and blocks also exhibit a **high positive correlation**. This is a logical relationship, as taller players, who typically play frontcourt positions, are more likely to achieve higher numbers in both categories. Furthermore, these two categories show a **positive correlation with field goal percentage**. This can be attributed to frontcourt players generally taking shots from closer to the basket, which results in a higher shooting percentage compared to players who shoot from a distance.\n",
    "* Field goal percentage appears to follow a **t-distribution centered around the 47% mark** (I determined it is  a t-distribution and not normal because of the wider tails). This indicates that most players' field goal percentages cluster near this average, with fewer players having extremely high or low percentages. On the other hand, Free throw percentage appears to follow a **t-distribution centered around the 75% mark** but the tails are much wider than those of the eild goal percentage stat. It means that large amount of players is considered as outliers in the FT% category. \n",
    "* The distributions of points, rebounds, and assists are **right-skewed**, indicating a **heavy-tailed distribution**. This distribution pattern confirms the presence of outliers and extreme values that are significantly greater than the majority of the data. Consistent with this skew, the **mean value for each of these features is higher than the median**, a direct result of the influence of these high-value outliers pulling the mean upwards.\n",
    "* Lastly, according to the correlation heatmap, the feature **Points** has a the strongest correlation with the total Z-score, while the feature **FG percentage** has the lowest correlation (though still solid) among all features."

    "### Additional EDA Conclusions\n",
    "**Based on the scatter plots and specialist analysis, here are the key conclusions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "#### Player Performance and Efficiency\n",
    "  * **Scoring Efficiency:** Frontcourt players, especially centers, are the most efficient scorers.\n",
    "  * **Passing Efficiency:** Players in the upper-right quadrant of the Assists vs. Turnovers plot are efficient passers. A select group of elite players with a Z-score above 1.5 in assists and a turnover Z-score of -0.5 or better are particularly valuable. These players significantly boost a team's assist numbers without negatively impacting turnovers, making them ideal for teams built around big men. *(Note: Be mindful of outliers like Jeff Dowtin Jr. and Keon Ellis, whose stats may be skewed due to a small sample size of games.)*\n",
    "  * **Frontcourt Versatility:** Some frontcourt players contribute positively to both rebounds and free-throw percentage. These players are an excellent fit for \"combo guard\" teams that prioritize 3-pointers and assists, as they won't lower the team's free-throw percentage average.\n",
    "  * **Steals & Fantasy Value:** Dyson Daniels from the 2024-2025 season is an extreme outlier in steals, with numbers unmatched by any player in the last three seasons. His exceptional performance in this category significantly elevated his fantasy rank. Excluding him, there is a clear positive correlation between a player's steals and their total fantasy score.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "-----\n",
    "#### Positional Analysis and Correlations\n",
    "  * **3-Pointers and Field Goal Percentage:** There is a small group of players who excel in both 3-pointers and field goal percentage. These players, primarily in backcourt positions, are a good fit for a balanced team that values both 3-pointers made and steals.\n",
    "  * **Overall Player Rankings:** Nikola Jokić has been the most efficient player in the 9-cat H2H format over the last three seasons.\n",
    "  * **Points' Impact:** Points have a major effect on overall fantasy rankings. A strong positive correlation is observed between points and `fantasy_z_9cat` across all positions.\n",
    "  * **3-Pointers' Impact:** While not immediately obvious from the graph, excluding players at the center position, there is a high correlation between 3-pointers made and the total Z-score. This suggests that 3-point shooting significantly boosts the fantasy ranks of power forwards and shooting guards.\n",
    "  * **Category-Specific Value:** A player's rank is heavily influenced by their added value in specific categories. For example, a guard who secures a high number of rebounds (relative to other guards) will be ranked higher than other players with similar or even higher rebound totals if their overall statistical profile is strong. The same principle applies to centers and power forwards who excel in assists.\n",
    "  * **\"Stocks\" Impact:** The graph visually demonstrates that \"stocks\" (steals and blocks) are a strong positive indicator of a player's total fantasy value in a 9-category league. The more steals and blocks a player accumulates, the more likely they are to be a top-ranked fantasy player.\n",
    "----\n",
    "#### Season-to-Season Consistency\n",
    "  * **Correlations:** There is a strong positive correlation between a player's fantasy value in consecutive seasons. The correlation remains strong between non-consecutive seasons, though it is slightly weaker. This suggests that a player's performance is a reliable indicator of future fantasy value.\n",
    "  * **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** The Mean Absolute Error between a player's fantasy value in consecutive seasons is 1.53. While a lower MAE is generally desirable, this value indicates a notable level of volatility in player performance. A player with a Z-score of 1.5 in one season could have a Z-score ranging from 0 to 3 the next season. Our predictive models will aim to outperform this benchmark."

    "### Archtypes conclusions\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " * <u>Swiss Army Knives (all-rounders)</u> - \n",
    "These are the rare unicorns of fantasy basketball. They don’t just contribute in one or two stats — they fill up every column of the box score. Players in this archetype give managers flexibility: you don’t need to punt categories or worry about glaring weaknesses when you draft one. They’re the safest building blocks because they help you win multiple categories every week.\n",
    "\n",
    " * <u>AST/TOV Specialists (great playmakers)</u> - \n",
    "Not all playmakers are created equal. Some pile up assists but also turn the ball over recklessly. The elite in this group thread the needle: they run the offense, rack up dimes, and still keep their mistakes to a minimum. They’re the hidden gems for managers who want steady guard production without tanking turnovers.\n",
    "\n",
    " * <u>Punt FT Bigs (rim protectors)</u> - \n",
    "The classic fantasy archetype: towering big men who dominate rebounds, blocks, and field goal percentage, but drag down your free throw shooting. On the surface they look like flawed players — but if you commit to punting FT%, they suddenly become game-changing anchors. They embody the strategy of embracing a weakness to supercharge your strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    " * <u>Defensive Kings (stocks monsters)</u> - \n",
    "Steals and blocks can swing matchups, and the players in this archetype specialize in them. Even if they don’t score much, their defensive presence makes them fantasy gold. Managers who lock down one or two of these guys can often secure the defense categories week after week, turning what looks like “glue guys” in real life into fantasy MVPs.\n",
    "\n",
    " * <u>Usage Monsters (PTS, REB, AST)</u> - \n",
    "Some players are simply the engine of their teams. Every possession runs through them, and that shows up in fantasy: big points, high assist numbers, and strong rebounding for their position. They may not be perfect in efficiency, but their sheer volume gives them unmatched influence in head-to-head matchups.\n",
    "\n",
    " * <u>Combo Guards (PTS, AST, 3PM, STL)</u> - \n",
    "This modern archetype thrives in pace-and-space basketball. Combo guards score in bunches, stretch defenses with threes, create for teammates, and disrupt passing lanes on defense. They might not offer elite rebounding or blocks, but their mix of offensive punch and opportunistic steals makes them fantasy darlings in guard builds."

    "#### Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    " * In this section we will use several regression models to predict a player's fantasy value based on his average season statistics. Since fantasy value is a continuous target (z-score across categories), regression is a natural choice. We experiment with both linear and non-linear approaches to balance interpretability and predictive power.\n",
    "---\n",
    " * **Linear Regression** – A statistical and machine learning method for finding the linear relationship between a continuous dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It serves as our baseline model because of its simplicity and interpretability.\n",
    " * **OLS by statsmodels** - As linear regression this model works to based on Ordinary Least Squares but in differ from the scikit-learn Linear Regression the models focuses Explanatory analysis - understanding the underlying relationships between variables and their statistical significance.\n",
    " * **Ridge Regression** – A variant of linear regression that adds an L2 penalty to shrink coefficients of correlated features. This helps reduce overfitting and improve stability when predictors are highly collinear (common in basketball stats such as PTS, USG%, and FGA).\n",
    " * **PCA + Linear Regression** – Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is first applied to reduce dimensionality and remove multicollinearity among features while retaining most of the variance (95%). A linear regression model is then trained on the compressed feature space, allowing us to capture the main signal with fewer dimensions.\n",
    " * **Random Forest Regressor** – An ensemble of decision trees where each tree is trained on a random subset of data and features. Random Forests can capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions, making them useful when the relationship between raw stats and fantasy value is not strictly linear.\n",
    " * **XGBoost Regressor** – A gradient boosting method that builds decision trees sequentially, where each tree corrects errors from the previous ones. XGBoost often outperforms Random Forest by focusing on difficult-to-predict cases and is widely used in applied machine learning competitions due to its high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of linear models limitations to handle with null values, we created a copy of the data frame where all NaN (located only on _roll and _delta columns) will get the value -999. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Our modeling strategy combines different types of features:\n",
    " * **Quantitative features:**  \n",
    "    <u>Box score statistics:</u> traditional per-game averages such as points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, and shooting percentages.  \n",
    "    <u>Durability metrics:</u> games played and minutes per game, since fantasy value is strongly affected by availability.  \n",
    "    <u>Rolling averages and deltas:</u> aggregated features from the previous two seasons to capture both consistency and trends in player development.  \n",
    " * **Qualitative feature:**  \n",
    "   <u>Demographics:</u> player age and position, as younger players often improve while older players may decline, and positions reflect different statistical profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then compare the model's predictive accuracy using MAE, RMSE, and R².\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Feature engineering for model's performance:\n",
    " * **Age:** Age often has a nonlinear relationship: Players improve until ~27–29, then decline. A quadratic term captures that curve. Instead of the model assuming “+1 year = always better/worse,” it can learn the “arc” of improvement then decline.\n",
    " * **Per 36 and totals:** Creating them to normalize the model's performance. We use them only for stats where per-minute scaling makes sense (PTS, REB, AST, STL, BLK) and not for stats as percetages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of OLS and the difference between the two models:\n",
    "* The core difference between statsmodels.OLS and scikit-learn.LinearRegression lies in their primary objective and the information they provide.\n",
    "* **statsmodels.OLS** is built for statistical inference and explanation. Its purpose is to help you understand the relationship between variables and the statistical significance of their coefficients. It provides a comprehensive summary table with statistical details like p-values, standard errors, and confidence intervals.It does not automatically add an intercept, forcing the user to explicitly add one with sm.add_constant().It may produce a better predictive model in cases where its slightly different implementation details or numerical procedures are a better fit for the specific characteristics of your data.\n",
    "* **scikit-learn.LinearRegression** is built for predictive modeling and machine learning workflows. It prioritizes ease of use, speed, and integration into larger pipelines for tasks like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.Its output is more concise, focusing on coefficients and basic performance scores like \\(R^{2}\\). It does not provide detailed statistical summaries with p-values.It includes an intercept by default, which can sometimes lead to different initial results compared to statsmodels if not handled correctly.\n",

    "## Modeling Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "**OLS** is the clear best performer, while **PCA + Linear Regression** and **OLS\\_PCA** performed poorly. Only **OLS** and the tree-based models (**XGBoost** and **Random Forest**) managed to outperform the **Baseline** in terms of R-squared, MAE and RMSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Dominance of OLS and the Regression Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaway is that **OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) is the best model** ($\\text{MAE}=1.750, R^2=0.714$).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Strong Linear Relationship Confirmed:** The high $R^2$ value ($\\mathbf{0.714}$) for OLS still confirms a **strong linear relationship** between the selected features and the target variable, `next_fantasy_z_9cat`.\n",
    "* **The Paradox of Poor Linear Model Performance:** It is highly unusual for **Linear Regression** ($\\text{MAE}=1.915, R^2=0.651$), **Ridge** ($\\text{MAE}=1.813, R^2=0.674$), and the PCA-based models to perform worse than the **Baseline** ($\\text{MAE}=1.857, R^2=0.669$).\n",
    "    * **The Likely Culprit: Multicollinearity.** Your correlation matrix (image **image_cfeb8f.png**) shows **very strong correlations** between features, such as `PTS` vs. `TOV` ($-0.84$), `PTS` vs. `AST` ($0.70$), and `REB` vs. `BLK` ($0.64$). When using the full feature set, this **multicollinearity** can make the standard Linear Regression coefficients highly unstable and inflate their variance, leading to poor generalization (i.e., poor out-of-sample performance, resulting in the low $R^2$ and high $\\text{MAE}$).\n",
    "    * **Why OLS Excels:** The OLS model used here appears to have successfully applied a **feature selection** step (likely by dropping features with high p-values) which is the most effective strategy for this dataset. By dropping the redundant/unstable features, it successfully stabilized the model, leading to the best performance.\n",
    "    * **Why Ridge Fails:** Ridge Regression is designed to handle multicollinearity by shrinking coefficients, but in this specific instance, the regularization penalty may have been too strong or the combination of highly correlated features was too complex for a standard Ridge approach to stabilize effectively without severely harming predictive power (resulting in $R^2=0.674$, only marginally better than the Baseline).\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Failure of Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **PCA-based models are the worst performers** ($\\mathbf{R^2 \\approx 0.63}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **PCA + Linear Regression** and **OLS\\_PCA** performed poorly, suggesting that simply transforming the features via **PCA destroyed some of the most critical predictive information**.\n",
    "* PCA is a rotation that maximizes variance but does not account for the target variable. In this case, **feature selection (as done by OLS)** was far more effective than feature transformation (PCA) at dealing with the feature redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Tree Models Outperform Most Linear Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree-based models, **XGBoost** ($\\text{MAE}=1.801, R^2=0.686$) and **Random Forest** ($\\text{MAE}=1.816, R^2=0.692$), both significantly **outperformed the standard Linear Regression and Ridge** models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This suggests that while the overall relationship is mostly linear, the tree-based models' ability to handle **feature interactions** and **multicollinearity implicitly** allowed them to stabilize better than the unstable linear models. They are robust alternatives to the highly tuned OLS model.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Robust Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature importance plots for **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** (images **image_d03d68.png** and **image_d03d82.png**) consistently highlight **scoring ability** as the top predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `num_PTS` and `num_PTS_per36` are the **most important features by a substantial margin**. This is a highly stable finding across all model iterations and corroborates the strong correlation of `PTS` with the target variable ($0.88$).\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Examination of Residuals\n",
    "\n",
    "The residual plots (images **image_d03d4a.png**, **image_cfebaa.png**, and **image_cfebad.png**) offer important insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Residual Distribution:** The histogram (image **image_d03d4a.png**) shows the residuals for PCA + Linear Regression **approximate a normal distribution** centered around zero, which is a key assumption for linear models.\n",
    "* **Homoscedasticity:** The **Linear Regression** and **Ridge** Residuals vs. Predicted plots (images **image_cfebaa.png** and **image_cfebad.png**) show a relatively **random scatter of points** around the $y=0$ line. This suggests the models' variance of errors is roughly constant (**homoscedasticity**), which is another positive assumption check for linear regression. The points do not fan out or show a clear pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Metrics to Consider\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a more complete picture of model performance, especially when dealing with poor-performing models, you should consider adding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):**\n",
    "    * **Formula:** $\\text{MAPE} = \\frac{100\\%}{n} \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\left| \\frac{A_t - F_t}{A_t} \\right|$\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** Measures accuracy as a percentage of the actual value, which is more intuitive for interpretation (e.g., \"The prediction is off by X\\% on average\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Adjusted R-squared:**\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This metric penalizes models that add features that do not significantly improve the fit. Since your OLS model is the best performer and likely used feature selection, comparing its $R^2$ to its **Adjusted $R^2$** would confirm that the discarded features were indeed non-contributory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Cross-Validation Scores (if not already done):**\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** Ensures the reported scores are stable and not due to a single fortunate train/test split. Since the linear models are struggling to generalize, comparing the **standard deviation of MAE** across 5-10 folds would show the volatility of each model."
